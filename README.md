# Bitcoin Chainstate Parser

This simple Ruby script parses the Bitcoin `~/.bitcoin/chainstate` LevelDB database.

It works on the chainstate database structure for **Bitcoin Core 0.15.1** and above.

**NOTE: I wrote this Ruby script so that I could get an understanding of the chainstate database structure. If you're looking to get the entire UTXO set quickly, check out this tool instead: [http://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump](http://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump)**

## Usage

You will need `libleveldb-dev` and the `leveldb-ruby` gem:

```
sudo apt install libleveldb-dev
sudo gem install leveldb-ruby
```

Then you can just:

```
ruby chainstate.rb
```

## What is the chainstate database?

The `~/.bitcoin/chainstate` folder contains a list of every unspent transaction output ([UTXO](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/utxo/)) in the blockchain. These UTXOs are stored in a [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) database, which is a key-value store database (like Redis), but it uses flat files instead of a database server.

This database allows bitcoin to get **fast access to unspent outputs**. This is vitally important for speeding up transaction validation, as bitcoin needs to grab the "locking scripts" for each output being spent. Without this database, bitcoin would need to trawl through the entire blockchain to find each output.

Now, seeing as this chainstate database will inevitably contain a large number of outputs, **the data has been compressed** as much as possible. So whilst this means the data takes up as little disk space as possible, it also means that it's _far from being human-readable_.

Furthermore, the data inside the database has also been _obfuscated_ to help prevent triggering any anti-virus software on some computers (although I'm not sure why that happens).

## How are the UTXOs stored in LevelDB?

LevelDB is a `key:value` store, so you could think of the UTXO database as looking something like this:

```
key1:value
key2:value
key3:value
```

You can get a `value` by using a specific `key`, or you can iterate through every `key:value` pair in the database (this script does the latter).

### Keys

Keys have the following structure (e.g. a UTXO entry):

```
key:   43000006b4e26afc5d904f239930611606a97e730727b40d1d82d4f3f1438cf2a101
       <><--------------------------------------------------------------><>
       /                              |                                   \
   type                             txid                                   vout
```

 * The **first byte** indicates the type of entry. A UTXO entry starts with `0x43`, which is "**C**" in ASCII.
 * The **next 32 bytes** is the [TXID](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/input/txid/) for the transaction the output was created in. This is in _[little-endian](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/general/little-endian/)_, so you will need to swap the byte order if you want to search for it on the blockchain.
 * The **last byte** is the [VOUT](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/input/vout/), which is the index number for a transaction output. (This is actually a Varint and not a single byte, but I'll come to that in a moment.)

### Values

First of all, every value in the database has been obfuscated, so you will need the get the `obfuscate_key` (the first entry in the database):

```
b12dcefd8f872536
```

An obfuscated `value` from the database will look something like this:

```
71a9e87d62de25953e189f706bcf59263f15de1bf6c893bda9b045
```

To deobfuscate it, you just need to extend the `obfuscate_key` to the _same length_ as the value, and then **XOR** the `value` with that extended `obfuscate_key`:

```
71a9e87d62de25953e189f706bcf59263f15de1bf6c893bda9b045  <- value
b12dcefd8f872536b12dcefd8f872536b12dcefd8f872536b12dce  <- extended obfuscate_key
c0842680ed5900a38f35518de4487c108e3810e6794fb68b189d8b  <- deobfuscated value (XOR)
```

_**NOTE:** The Bitwise XOR operator is useful for toggling [bits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31575691/what-is-a-bitmask-and-a-mask/31576303#31576303) on and off (from 0 to 1 and vice versa). Therefore, XORing the value with the key obfuscates it, and XORing it again with the same key will de-obfuscate it._

The deobfuscated `value` of a UTXO entry in the database has the following structure:

```
value:  c0842680ed5900a38f35518de4487c108e3810e6794fb68b189d8b
        <----><----><><-------------------------------------->
          /      |    \                   |
    varint    varint   varint          script <- hash160 for P2PKH and P2SH, public key for P2PK, full script for rest
        |    (amount)  (nSize)
        |        \
 decode |         decompress
        |
        |
   100000100001010100110
   <------------------>^coinbase
          height
```

To read through the data, you need to be able to read and decode [**Varints**](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints). These are just numbers that have been serialized in a specific way to help reduce the amount of space they take up within structured data. They are popular in binary protocols (because they are more efficient than fixed-length fields when transmitting numbers that vary in length).

---

#### Varints

To read a varint, you just need to keep reading bytes until the **first bit is not set**. For that we need to look at each byte in its _binary representation_. Using the example above:

```
c0842680ed5900a38f35518de4487c108e3810e6794fb68b189d8b

c0 = 11000000
84 = 10000100
26 = 00100110 <- first bit not set, so stop reading bytes
```

So the first varint we have read is `c08426`. To decode this varint in to an actual value; take the last 7 bits of each of these bytes, _add 1 to each byte_ (except for the last), then concatenate the bits:

```
11000000 10000100 00100110
 1000000  0000100  0100110 <- last 7 bits of each byte
 1000001  0000101  0100110 <- add 1 to each byte (except for the last)
 100000100001010100110     <- concatenate
```

So there we have read and decoded a Varint (which in decimal is `1065638`).

---

#### 1. First Varint

The first varint in the `value` contains the **height of the block** and whether or not the output is from a **coinbase transaction**.

```
value:  c0842680ed5900a38f35518de4487c108e3810e6794fb68b189d8b
        <---->
          /
      varint
        |
        | decode
        |
   100000100001010100110
   <------------------>^coinbase
          height
```

The **last bit** is used for indicating if **coinbase**, and all previous bits indicate the **height**.

So in this example:

 * **Height** = `0b10000010000101010011` = `532819`
 * **Coinbase** = `0b0` = `false`

#### 2. Second Varint

The second varint in the `value` tells you the `amount` of bitcoins stored in the output (in satoshis).

```
value:  c0842680ed5900a38f35518de4487c108e3810e6794fb68b189d8b
              <---->
                |
              amount (compressed)
```

However, this value has been **compressed**, so you need to decompress it to get the actual value. I'm not entirely sure how this works, but the process can be found in the [`decompress_value.rb`](https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-chainstate-parser/blob/master/decompress_value.rb) function (or even better, the [bitcoin source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/compressor.cpp#L141)).

Nonetheless, the result of decoding and decompressing the varint above is this:

```
80ed59  <- varint  (hexadecimal)
30553   <- varint decoded (decimal)
339500  <- decompressed (decimal)
```

#### 3. Third Varint

The third and final varint is referred to as [`nSize`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/compressor.cpp#L96). This essentially indicates the _type_ of upcoming [locking script](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/output/scriptpubkey/).

```
value:  c0842680ed5900a38f35518de4487c108e3810e6794fb68b189d8b
                    <>
                     \
                      nSize
```

The values for `nSize` indicate the following about the upcoming script data:

```
00  = P2PKH <- upcoming data is the hash160 public key
01  = P2SH  <- upcoming data is the hash160 of a script
02  = P2PK  <- upcoming data is a compressed public key (nsize makes up part of the public key) [y=even]
03  = P2PK  <- upcoming data is a compressed public key (nsize makes up part of the public key) [y=odd]
04  = P2PK  <- upcoming data is an uncompressed public key (but has been compressed for leveldb) [y=even]
05  = P2PK  <- upcoming data is an uncompressed public key (but has been compressed for leveldb) [y=odd]
06+ =       <- indicates size of upcoming full script (subtract 6 to get the actual size in bytes)
```

The script data has been compressed as much as possible. For example, the [`P2PKH`](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/script/p2pkh/), [`P2SH`](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/script/p2sh/), and [`P2PK`](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/script/p2pk/) scripts follow the same patterns of OP_CODES, and the only unique part of these scripts is the public keys and script hashes, so we just store those in LevelDB instead of the full script.

Other non-standard scripts get stored in full, so the `nSize` is just used the indicate the _size_ of those scripts (subtract 6 from this value thought to get the script size, to account for the fact that the values of 0-5 were taken for specifying a specific script type).

#### 4. Remaining Data

The remainding data is the `script data`. This is going to be a **public key hash**, **script hash**, **public key**, or a **full script**.

For example, the `nSize` was `00`, which means that this is a **hash160 public key** (from inside a `P2PKH` script):

```
value:  c0842680ed5900a38f35518de4487c108e3810e6794fb68b189d8b
                      <-------------------------------------->
                                          |
                                        script <- hash160 for P2PKH and P2SH, public key for P2PK, full script for rest
```

**TIP:** You can get an _address_ from this script data if it's a `P2PKH`, `P2SH`, `P2WPKH`, or `P2WSH` script.
